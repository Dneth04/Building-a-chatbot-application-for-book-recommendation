# Building-a-chatbot-application-for-book-recommendation

This project revolves around crafting an automated Chatbot Application for Book Recommendations. Leveraging Langchain and its modules, the focus is on delivering personalized recommendations through interactive conversations. The system ensures real-time data retrieval by integrating SerpAPI. I've emphasized responsible use of OpenAI API for ethical deployment. Motivated by the need for innovative solutions, I aim to incorporate dynamic data generation solely through AI processes. By combining generative AI models, Langchain, SERP-API and Streamlit for interface, the project aims to revolutionize book recommendation systems, offering users a seamless and user-friendly experience.

I developed this samll project under the guidance of a computer science faculty during my third year. It was a great learning process!!
